# USV-Project-Module-Semester-1
In this module I learned the process of electronic device design by creating a custom PCB board that connect to a BBC Microbit module.
This custom board expands the existing feature-set of the BBC microbit by adding Wi-Fi networking and Bluetooth support, an LCD screen,
eight servo motor connections, audio output, and serial communication.
