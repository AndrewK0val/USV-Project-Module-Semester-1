# USV-Project-Module-Semester-1
In this module I learned the process of electronic device design by creating a custom PCB board which will connect to a BBC Microbit module.
This custom board expands the existing feature-set of the BBC microbit by adding Wi-Fi networking and Bluetooth support, an LCD screen,
eight servo motor connections, audio output, and serial communication.

This is the finished schematic design:

shown below is the complete board design:

This is the curerent iteration of the enclusure design to house the interface device. I have an obsession for automodive body design therefore
I wanted to incorporate a sports-car aesthetic to the housing of my custom board.
I plan to drill two holes on each side for each circular insert section.
The design was created in Blender (free and open-source 3d-graphics and visual effects software)

This design will be 3D-printed in two parts (the main body and the lid) on an Ender 3 Pro 3D printer.
