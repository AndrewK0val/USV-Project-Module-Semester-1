# USV-Project-Module-Semester-1
In this module I learned the process of electronic device design by creating a custom PCB board which will connect to a BBC Microbit module.
This custom board expands the existing feature-set of the BBC microbit by adding Wi-Fi networking and Bluetooth support, an LCD screen,
eight servo motor connections, audio output, and serial communication.


Autodesk Eagle was used to create the schematic and board design.

This is the finished schematic design:

Shown below is the complete board design:

Once the two designs were complete, gerber files were generated in Eagle and sent to a PCB manufacturer.
Depicted below is the printed PCB board:

This is the current iteration of the enclusure design to house the interface device. I have an obsession for automodive body design therefore
I wanted to incorporate a sports-car aesthetic to the housing of my custom board.
I plan to drill two holes on each side for each circular insert section to route cables for the 12v power and audio jack.
The design was created in Blender (free and open-source 3d-graphics and visual effects software)

This design will be 3D-printed in two parts (the main body and the lid) on an Ender 3 Pro 3D printer.
